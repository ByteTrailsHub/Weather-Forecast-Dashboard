# Weather Forecast App

## Introduction
A simple application that fetches and displays real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap.

### Motivation
Hello and welcome to my GitHub! üëã
I‚Äôve always been fascinated by coding, but it took me a while to finally take the leap and start learning. Now, I‚Äôm excited to build, experiment, and grow my skills one project at a time. 
This Weather Forecast App is part of my journey to gain hands-on experience working with external APIs and creating user-friendly tools.

### Description
Stay updated with the latest weather conditions using this Weather Forecast App! Just enter your city, and the app will retrieve current weather data (like temperature and sky conditions) from OpenWeatherMap. 
Perfect for planning your day, traveling, or simply keeping track of local weather patterns.
